# state_estimation
State Estimation Project

Multiple sensors provide data
which can be combined using 
sensor fusion using a Bayesian
estimation algorithm based on
a prediction step followed by
an update step. 

The algorithm aims to reduce 
sensor error and tend toward 
the true value. 

Steps required:

- data collection prototyping
  using currently a rPi to 
  receive and log data
  (completed)

- data analysis to build models
  (currently here)

- run algorithm on data to test

- tweaking of the algorithm 
  and data processing analysis
  methods to achieve best result

- implementation in more suitable
  hardware with realtime display
  of state estimation
